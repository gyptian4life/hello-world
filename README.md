GitHub Hello World Tutorial

I work at a software company in San Leandro, California called OSIsoft. However, I have no experience writing code and VERY little experience reading code. Trying to improve my skills so I am taking a general Computer Science on edX called CS50 (provided by Harvard). This (setting up a GitHub account) is a part of the Week 0 assignment.
